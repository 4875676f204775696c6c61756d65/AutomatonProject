# AutomatonProject

Automaton development project.

Implementation of several common algorithms on automatons.

The project is entirely made in Cpp without any third party library except the STL.

Main.cpp can accommodate a processing loop. 

The code respects the principles of modual and object-oriented programming.

The automatons are loaded in memory from .txt file thanks to <fstream>.
